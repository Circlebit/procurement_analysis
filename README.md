# Topic Modeling Procurement Data

This repo holds code and documentation for a research project on the texts of procurement notices.
The project is done in context of the seminar _Topic Modeling in R with focus on Structural Topic Models_ at _Universit√§t Kassel_ held by Dr. Oliver Wieczorek in 2025.

This repo is structured as monorepo holding several Python and R projects that should be run in order to reproduce the results:

1. [procurement-data-fetcher](./01_data-fetcher_py/README.md) - downloading and pre-processing procurement data from public API
2. fitting models, extracting interpretable results (R, TODO)
3. creating plots (Python?, TODO)
